Java  multi-state SALT model CA, based on Fredkin / Miller BusyBox[1] algorithm


This code is implemented in Java as a project for the Processing[2]  environment.

For compilation docs and how-to for implementing new rules, see the Google Doc 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vf10l80H6OTJVNZK0XvpxnGTRwgBHSyU9TEVgzC9ng8/edit?usp=sharing

This project is designed to make it easier to explore and implement new rule sets in the six-phase
SALT model, such as those created by Dan Miller for the Busy Box rule.
